# DankiDemAnki
Collaborative German Anki decks for Media IT studies <br>
The Anki-addon [CrowdAnki](https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki) is used for the distribution via GitHub.

## Before you start
* Install [CrowdAnki](https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki).
* You should create a new Anki user dedicated to DankiDemAnki, because when importing Anki decks, all of the current user's data will be overwritten.
* **The directory of this repository should be the folder "collection.media" of your designated Anki user.** Here you will have a folder for each deck/subject.
* Also, please make sure Anki is running the most recent version.

Also, just as a quick warning: CrowdAnki doesn't seem to be very stable or well bugfixed. On my first two days of working with it, I've already encountered various ways to freeze or crash your Anki app, so please follow the instructions carefully.

## Importing
Be sure you pull before importing for the most recent version.
When you have this repo on your user's "collection.media" folder, you can import Anki cards by following these steps:
* "Data" -> "CrowdAnki: Import From Disk" -> Choose your subject folder (For example "Betriebssysteme". Not "collection.media"!) -> OK. <br>
You should now have successfully imported all the recent updates of the repo into you Anki app.
 

## Creating new DankiDemAnki cards
* To make working with Anki more user friendly, I'd encourage you to use a consistent style when creating new cards.
* Use as few highlighting as possible, but as much as needed.
* Try to use different approaches to the medium. Don't always write "Wie lautet die Definition von x?", try to get creative when possible!
* Use images, videos, helpful internet ressources! A picture often says more than a thousand words. :)
* I myself haven't done so yet, but don't be afraid of using different card layouts (instead of only front and backside)!

## Exporting
* "Data" -> "Export" -> **Choose the "CrowdAnki JSON..." format and only your current subject's deck!** Deviating from this may lead to others not being able to import your data or your app crashing. Include Media and Tags. -> "Export..." -> Choose your user's "collection.media" folder
You should now have successfully exported all of your updates into the repo. If you have GitHub Desktop installed, you can see your changes there.
